## Web management
The [online web portal](https://ide.adama-platform.com) needs a lot of work to be useful.
The web portal should be upgraded to provide a manager view along with tools to get started along with steps to make progress.

## Language
The language is going to big with many features!

| project                | IP  | milestones/description                                                                                                                                              |
|------------------------|-----|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| index-tensor           |     | Tables should be indexable based on integer tuples. Beyond efficiency, language extensions can help work with tables in a more natural array style (think 2D grids) |

### Notes on bag type

```adama

enum E {Aa, Ab, B, C}
bag<E> B {
  A* {
    int x;
  }
  B {
    int x;
    int y;
  }
  C { }
}
```

The bag creates a record with the union of all fields along with various along with a virtual type for each instance which maps to the appropriate subset.
We can derefence it via a match

```adama
B my_bag;
#sm {
  match B as o {
    A* {
      o.x = 123;
    }
    B {
      o.x = 42;
      o.y = 7;
    }
    C {
    }
  }
}
```

Implicitly a bag has a type of the enumeration, and ingestion would be the way to set the type along with parameters.

```adama
my_bag <- {type: E::Aa, x: 42};
```

This will typecheck that the bag has everything needed and will clear other fields out. This is all sketch work, but the key design goal is to provide some degree of compact representation of data based on the kind of a thng.


## Infrastructure - Protocols
For integration across different ecosystems, there are more protocols to bridge gaps.

## Infrastructure - Core Service
Adama is a service.

| project                  | IP | milestones/description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| third-party replication  | X  | the language should allow specification of a endpoint to replace a piece of data to on data changes. This requires maintaining a local copy in the document along with a state machine about status. The tricky bit requires a delete notification. There is also the need to load every document on a deployment. |

Similar to RxHTML, the question is how to build a minimal runtime for iOS and Android applications. Tactically speaking, we can use RxHTML with [capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/).
